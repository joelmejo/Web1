    <p>Moodle Pty Ltd and its affiliated companies (“Moodle”, “we” or “us”), is the company at the heart of the open source Moodle Project: empowering educators to improve our world. This privacy notice sets out how Moodle collects and uses information about you when you use our products and services (“services”) and why we collect certain personal data. This notice also explains the choices that you can make about the way that we use your information.</p>
    <p>Your privacy protection is important to us. This is why we have adopted the following pivotal legislation: EU’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (“CCPA”). This privacy notice relates to all personal data we process and addresses the legislation mentioned.</p>
    <p>‘Personal data’, in this privacy notice, means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is someone who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>

    <h2>Useful resources</h2>
    <p>We remain committed to building a secure LMS that protects the privacy and security of learners' and employees’ data. We provide all users with the tools to ensure that their data, information and operations are secure and protected. Privacy features embedded with Moodle LMS ensure that Moodle is GDPR compliant and adheres to local privacy legislation requirements. However, some responsibility for compliance and safety rests with the organisation that controls each Moodle installation. We encourage institutions and organisations to implement security measures for their Moodle installation and:</p>

    <p>Our legal bases for controlling or processing personal data are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Article 6.1(a) GDPR (Consent):</strong> You provide informed consent to us or have a reasonable expectation that we will use your information in a certain way – for example, to engage in our community discussions, or to hear about new services or offers.

    <li><strong>Article 6.1(f) GDPR (Legitimate Interest):</strong> Where it is in our legitimate interests to do so. We only rely on ‘legitimate interests’ as the legal basis for processing by us, or third parties we use, for these purposes:
    <ul>

    <li>emergency contacts for people who work with us, such as employees and contractors for health and safety purposes;</li>

    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where we rely on a specific basis for processing your information and you wish to object to that processing, you must be aware that it might not be possible for you to continue using our services.</p>
    <p>The special categories of personal data <strong>(Article 9 of GDPR)</strong> we process are:</p>

    <h2>How we use personal data</h2>
    <div class="privacy-content "><p>We may need to pass your personal data on to third-party service providers contracted to Moodle in the course of dealing with you. We do this because there are services, such as our video conferencing facility, which will not work unless we are able to make these transfers. Any third parties we share your data with are obliged to keep your personal data secure and use it only for necessary service delivery. When your data is no longer required to fulfil the service, those third parties will be directed to dispose of your data in accordance with our standard procedures.</p>
    <p>We seek to enter into Data Processing Agreements with our third party service providers to ensure they only process your data as instructed by us. If you obtain products or services directly from us on behalf of others we will ensure you enter into a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DPA-Moodle-Processor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Data Processing Agreement (DPA) (external link, opens in a new tab)">Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</a> with us.

    <h2>How we store personal data</h2>
    <div class="privacy-content "><p>We will process (collect, store and use) the information you provide in a manner compatible with GDPR. We maintain physical, organisational and technical safeguards for all personal data we hold. We will endeavour to keep your information accurate and up to date, and not keep it for longer than is necessary. We are required to retain certain information in accordance with the law, such as information needed for income tax and audit purposes. How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept are governed by specific business sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data can be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.</p>
    <p>We will process different forms of personal data for as long as it is necessary and proportionate for the purpose for which it has been supplied and we will store the personal data for the shortest amount of time possible, taking into account legal and service requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <div class="privacy-content "><p>We have no interest in collecting any data beyond that needed to ensure our services work for you.
